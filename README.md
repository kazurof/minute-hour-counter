This is a porting of the source code in Chapter 13 of The Art of Readable Code, written in Kotlin.
Original code was written in C++.


It looked hard to me to understand C++ code. To understand deeply and practice of Kotlin, I re-writeed this to Kotlin.

refer folder under [`lib/src/main/kotlin/mhc`](lib/src/main/kotlin/mhc) to see the code.
